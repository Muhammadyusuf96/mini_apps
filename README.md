Here I will put small projects.

## List of mini projects:

- [DDQRScaner](#DDQRScaner)

## ProportionsCalculator

The calculator uses cross multiplication to solve. You must first enter the base ratio in the boxes above the line, then you can enter the unknown. Fields can be automatically added up to 20 when filling in the last field. All calculations will be made relative to the base ratio. All fields are reset when you change the base ratio.

## DDQRScaner

This is a simple PyQt6-based application that allows users to scan QR codes by dragging and dropping QR code images onto the application window. It also provides options to copy the displayed text or open it as a URL if applicable.
