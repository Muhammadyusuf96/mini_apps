## ProportionsCalculator

This is a user-friendly tkinter based GUI calculator designed for performing proportional calculations. Users can input values, and the calculator utilizes cross-multiplication to solve proportional problems. Start by entering the base ratio in the top two fields, then input the unknown value. The calculator can dynamically add up to 20 additional fields when you fill in the last one. All calculations are based on the provided base ratio, and if you change the base ratio, all fields will reset automatically.

## DDQRScaner

This is a simple PyQt6-based application that allows users to scan QR codes by dragging and dropping QR code images onto the application window. It also provides options to copy the displayed text or open it as a URL if applicable.
