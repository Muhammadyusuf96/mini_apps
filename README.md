Here I will put small projects.

## List of mini projects:

- [ProportionsCalculator](#ProportionsCalculator) - This is a proportions calculator.
- [DDQRScaner](#DDQRScaner) - QR code scanner
- [UnicodeInputHelper](#UnicodeInputHelper) - Insert Unicode character by its UTF-16 hex code.
- [C](#c)

## ProportionsCalculator

This is a user-friendly tkinter based GUI calculator designed for performing proportional calculations. Users can input values, and the calculator utilizes cross-multiplication to solve proportional problems. Start by entering the base ratio in the top two fields, then input the unknown value. The calculator can dynamically add up to 20 additional fields when you fill in the last one. All calculations are based on the provided base ratio, and if you change the base ratio, all fields will reset automatically.

## DDQRScaner

This is a simple PyQt6-based application that allows users to scan QR codes by dragging and dropping QR code images onto the application window. It also provides options to copy the displayed text or open it as a URL if applicable.

## UnicodeInputHelper

The script provides a convenient way to input Unicode characters using the 'Alt+Plus' hotkey. It operates in the background with a system tray icon, allowing users to right-click for an exit option. The script prompts users to input a UTF-16 hex code, converting it to a Unicode character and pasting it into the active window. Error handling is included for invalid hex codes, and the script offers customization options. Overall, it simplifies Unicode input across applications.
